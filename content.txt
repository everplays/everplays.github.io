I am a huge free software enthusiast and made many contributions to different projects with different programming languages. Some other places to find out more about me:

Expertise:

 * Front-end and back-end web development.
 * Mobile development (Hybrid and native).
 * Modular, scalable, readable and reusable code.
 * Performance optimization and scaling.
 * API design.

Note: I would be an asset to projects that use a mixture of programming languages as I can work with many imperative and functional languages.

Technical skills:

 * Ruby (Rails, rspec, cucumber, Sinatra, ...)
 * Javascript (ExtJS, EmberJS, jQuery, Mootools, Mocha, Chai, ...)
 * Scala (Sbt, Play!, akka, ...)
 * PHP (Agavi, Symfony, ezComponents, ...)
 * Python (Django, GTK+, ...)
 * Git
 * Java
 * Erlang
 * Vala
 * Objective-J
 * Clojure
 * Objective-C
 * Apache
 * Nginx
 * Postgresql
 * Redis
 * MySQL
 * Memcached
 * Solr
 * Linux
 * and many more

Note: Why so many languages? basically all imperative languages are the same and syntax changes a bit (It is the same for functional languages). In that practice, I have professional knowledge of just two kind of languages: Imperative and Functional which is not too much.
